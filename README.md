# Frontend Mentor - Social Links Profile

This is my solution to the [Social Links Profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ).  
It was built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**. The goal was to create a responsive user profile card with clickable social links.
